# T.otal R.ecall EX.tension

A Chrome extension for those who use their browser tabs as their short term (and long term) memory&mdash;i.e. *me*.

##Why?

Offloading work from your prefrontal cortex (working/short-term memory) and hippocampus/[seahorse](http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_07/d_07_cr/d_07_cr_tra/d_07_cr_tra.html) (long term memory) is something I **DON'T** recommend. But it still happens. A horder's gonna horde.

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress and most definitely in a "prerelease" state. There is a lot of junk code, very little documentations, and several major, incomplete features. Use at your own risk.
